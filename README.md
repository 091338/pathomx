# Introduction

**Stable** The current trunk of MetaPath is stable and able to build using cx_Freeze on Mac. The latest version (0.9.9) is now available to download
from [Mac OS X Mountain Lion .app][metapath-macapp] &bull; [Github][metapath-github] &bull; [Python .eggs or .gz source][metapath-pypi].

MetaPath is an interactive tool for the analysis and visualisation of metabolic data.
Built on the [MetaCyc][metacyc] database it allows rapid exploration of complex datasets
through configurable and extensible plugin. Multiple annotations from the MetaCyc database are 
available including synonyms, associated reactions and pathways and database unification links.

Metabolomics and genomic data can be imported via various routes for visualisation on
targeted pathways. Pathways can be mined and removed algorithmically to identify key
regulated pathways within in a given dataset providing a simper route to metabolic
function.

**Download** [Mac OS X Mountain Lion .app][metapath-macapp] &bull; [Github][metapath-github] &bull; [Python .eggs or .gz source][metapath-pypi].

> MetaPath requires installation of [Graphviz][graphviz] for pathway drawing.
