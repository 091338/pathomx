<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Heatmaps are a common graphical representation of data where relative values are representation as colors on a graduated scale.
In a biological context they are commonly used to show up and down-regulation of genes.</p>

<p>This plugin allows for visualisation of both raw concentration and transformed fold-change or log2 data for genes, proteins, metabolites and
any other measured entity. Pre-defined maps are offered, built on the incorporated MetaCyc database to address broad questions. Alternatively,
custom maps may be built by adding/removing entities or defining classification groups. Entities can also be fed in from other 
analysis (e.g. the output of the data mining plugin).</p>

<p>Alternate scales are provided for convenience showing change on a low:high scale with blue:red or red:green.</p>

<h2>Quick start</h2>

<p><a href="metapath://@view.id/default_actions/data_source/add" class="btn"><img src="file:///@htmlbase/../icons/database-import.png"> Select source data</a> to generate a heatmap. Multiple data types are supported including raw data or processed/analysed data outputs.
The data source can be selected through the <img src="file:///@htmlbase/../icons/database-import.png"> data input interface. Using the same
interface you can also optionally select a set of entities to visualise, or select them manually from the primary data source.
