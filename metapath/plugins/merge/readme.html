<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Experimental systems can often be measured by multiple means, and a method for the re-integration of these data is essential. This plugin
offers a simple method to merge quantified data from different sources. </p>

<h2>Quick start</h2>
<p><a href="metapath://@view.id/default_actions/data_source/add" class="btn"><img src="file:///@htmlbase/../icons/database-import.png"> Select source data</a> 
and merging will be applied automatically. Entities are added from each dataset in turn <em>providing they are not already present</em> in the preceding datasets.
In this way you can combine multiple measures in order of confidence. Ranking is performed in order of connection, e.g. a data source on connector 1 will be
ranked above one on connector 2. </p>

<p>The resulting dataset may contain >1 entry/entity (e.g. two measurements for a given metabolite). You may wish to subsequently 
filter this, e.g. by getting a mean per-metabolite summary.</p>

<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>You will probably want to scale your source data by a similar metric (e.g. unit variance, TMSP) before merging or you may find data from 
different sources are weighted differently in subsequent analysis.</p>
