<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Data binning is a widely used data pre-processing technique that can be used to reduce the effects of minor observational errors.
It can also be used to reduce the size of a dataset for easier processing. Regions of the data (bins) are defined, within which
data is replaced with a representative value, e.g. a mean, median or central value. It is a form of quantization.</p>

<p>It is important to remember that binning results in a loss of data, and may introduce artefacts. This plugin attempts to 
mitigate some of these problems by providing information on data loss, and offering adaptive binning approaches.</p>

<h2>How to use</h2>

<p>This plugin can bin any data in 1 dimension, e.g. NMR spectra. Simply select the data source and the data will be automatically binned.
You can adjust the bin size using the toolbar, together with a bin offset. You can view the result of the binning a tabular, or 
spectral view. Importantly, this plugin also presents a difference view that shows the data loss associated with a given binning strategy, 
together with a summary view.</p>

<h2>Tip</h2>

<p>Resulting data output can be fed into statistical analysis, for example PCA, where the effects of binning can be observed live.</p>
