    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>MetaPath is a tool for the analysis of metabolic pathway and associated visualisation of experimental data. Built on the <a href="http://metacyc.org">MetaCyc</a>
    database it provides an interactive map in which multiple pathways can be simultaneously visualised.
    Multiple annotations from the MetaCyc database are available including synonyms, associated reactions and pathways and database unification links.</p>
    
    <p>Metabolomics change data can be imported via simple <code title="Command-separated values">CSV</code> formats for visualisation on targeted pathways. Pathways can be mined and removed
    algorithmically to identify key regulated pathways within in a given dataset providing a simper route to metabolic function.</p>
    
    <h2>License</h2>
    <p>MetaPath is available free for any use, licensed under the GPLv3.</p>
    <p class="hilite">MetaPath is built on the <a href="http://metacyc.org">MetaCyc</a> pathway database itself part of the <a href="http://biocyc.org">BioCyc</a> and <a href="http://humancyc.org">HumanCyc</a> family.
    The supplied database is generated via the MetaCyc API and stored locally. Licenses for the entire MetaCyc database <a href="http://metacyc.org/contact.shtml">are also available</a>
    free of charge for academic and government use.</p>
    
    <p class="hilite">Molecular structures are derived from the KEGG database, developed by Kanehisa Laboratories. 
    If using molecular structure annotations please cite the following article(s):

    <h2>Getting Started</h2>
    <h5>Pathway Explorer</h5>
    <p>To start simply select 'Pathways' from the menu bar and select to 'Show Selected Pathways...'</p>
    <img src="file://@htmlbase/img/help-select-pathways.png">
    <p>This displays the pathway selection dialog where you can opt to show any pathways currently in the local database. You can select individual 
    pathways by clicking, or select multiple pathways with Option-click (Mac) or Ctrl-click (Windows).
    You can also bulk add/remove pathways using the search box beneath. This optionally supports regular expressions allowing for specific matching of complex names.</p></p>
    <p>You can also opt to hide specific pathways from view. Pathways selected in this dialog will not be displayed (even if specifically requested in 
    the show pathway box. You may find this useful if you are working on cells or organisms that do not feature particular pathways.</p>
    <img src="file://@htmlbase/img/help-select-pathways-show.png">
    <img src="file://@htmlbase/img/help-select-pathways-map.png">
    <p>Back on the 'Pathways' menu you can also opt to 'Highlight Reaction Pathways' to color pathways by colour and to 'Show Links to Hidden Pathways' which shows links from metabolites
    to currently invisible pathways. This can be useful to see currently hidden links between metabolites.
    <em>Note: This can sometimes take a while to complete, particularly on large maps.</em>
    Pathway nodes can be clicked to access database metadata.
    </p>
    <img src="file://@htmlbase/img/help-select-pathways-map-hidden.png">
    <img src="file://@htmlbase/img/help-select-pathways-map-hidden-info.png">
    <p>You can also simplify/further annotation the pathway map using the View menu including adding 2&deg; metabolites, enzymes/reaction names, and pathway-analysis hints showing 
    metabolite connectivity.</p>

    <h5>Database</h5>
    <p>All map objects are accessible in the same way, including metabolites, reactions and pathways. Click on any item (pathways can also be selected by the light-grey bounding box)
    to bring up object metadata in the sidebar.</p>
    <img src="file://@htmlbase/img/help-database-pathway.png">
    <img src="file://@htmlbase/img/help-database-reaction.png">
    <img src="file://@htmlbase/img/help-database-metabolite.png">
    <p>You can browse the database from the sidebar, exploring pathway, reaction and metabolite relationships. Pathways can be added to the main
    map at any time by clicking the links (<img src="file://@htmlbase/img/img/icon_addlink.gif"><img src="file://@htmlbase/img/icon_deletelink.gif">) or buttons on the pathway view and the map will automatically update.
    The database also contains links both to the online <a href="http://metacyc.org">MetaCyc</a> database and to other related resources including 
                    <a href="http://www.genome.ad.jp/">KEGG</a>,
                    <a href="http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/">PubChem</a>,
                    <a href="http://www.commonchemistry.org/">CAS</a>,
                    <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/">CHEBI</a> and
                    <a href="http://kanaya.naist.jp/knapsack_jsp/top.html">KNApSAcK</a>.
    </p>
    


    <p>MetaPath will automatically adjust the visualisation color-scales to suit the data using linear or logN representation. Summary statistics about the dataset and 
    information on current scaling is displayed in the sidebar when loading data. This can also be accessed at any time via the <strong>?</strong> on the toolbar.
    <br /><em>Note: MetaPath's choices for color-scale may be overridden if required from the data menu.</em></p>

    <img src="file://@htmlbase/img/help-data-colours.png">
    
    <p>Metabolite concentration delta (difference between control and test) is shown on the metabolic pathway map by colour scale with blue indicating down and red up. This
    information is also shown in the sidebar when browsing the database. You can change the experiment currently displayed using the data toolbar.</p>

    <h5>Pathway Pruning</h5>
    <p>In untargeted metabolic studies it is often useful to determine the key areas of metabolic regulation within a system.
    MetaPath supports pathway-based mining of experimental data, using a number of different scoring algorithms, which has the added 
    benefit of proving context for the identified change.</p>
    <p>To enable pathway pruning, simply load data as above then enable pruning via the menubar.</p>  
    <img src="file://@htmlbase/img/help-data-menu-pruning.png">
    <p>Starting with the entire network of metabolic pathways in the database, each pathway will be scored according to the chosen method
    and lower-scoring pathways removed from the view up to the set pruning threshold. The remaining pathways are displayed, giving an overview
    of the key pathways in the system. Note that pruning obeys the 'Show Selected Pathways...' settings which can be useful to link disparate pathways into a regulated whole.</p>
    <img src="file://@htmlbase/img/help-data-pruning-settings.png">
    <img src="file://@htmlbase/img/help-data-pruning-map.png">
    <p>The scoring algorithm can be altered from the 'Pruning settings...' dialog. Scoring can be based on upregulation, downregulation, overall change and by the number of identified metabolites in the sample. Adjusting scores
    relative to the number of metabolites in a pathway removes the bias towards larger pathways (although this is often preferable for interpretation).
    You can adjust the pruning threshold from the data toolbar.</p>

    <h5>Saving Your Work & Finishing Up</h5>
    <p>Generated pathway maps can be saved to multiple formats including <code>tif</code>, <code>eps</code>, <code>fig</code>, <code>gif</code>, <code>jpeg</code>, <code>pdf</code>, <code>png</code>, <code>ps</code>, <code>svg</code>, <code>dot</code> and <code>bmp</code>.
    When you close MetaPath your current session settings are saved and will be restored next time. However, you will need to reload any datafiles for visualisation or mining.</p>

    <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
    <p>MetaPath is under continued development. If you spot bugs, or have suggestions for improvement, please submit them via our <a href="">github bug tracker</a>.
